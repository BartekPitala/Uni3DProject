WELCOME TO MMP SHOOTER!
AT EASE, SOLDIER. THIS IS A SHORT INTRODUCITON TO GAME PRINCIPLES AND MECHANICS
DUE TO AN EXPERIMENT THAT WENT OUT OF CONTROL, THE CITY OF NEW YORK HAS BEEN INFECTED
WITH A DEADLY DISEASE. WHAT'S WORSE SOME OF THE DECEASED RISE AGAIN AS BLOODTHIRSTY
ZOMBIES! WHOEVER COULD, EVACUTAED FROM THE CITY. A QUARANTINE HAS BEEN APPLIED TO
PREVENT FURTHER SPREAD OF THE DISEASE. THE NEW YORK CITY IS NOW A GHOST TOWN...
BUT THE TIME HAS COME TO RECLAIM THE CROWN JEWEL OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION!
YOU ARE A MEMBER OR AN ELITE STRIKE FORCE-YOUR JOB IS TO ENTER THE CITY AND EXTERMINATE
THE UNWELCOME GUESTS. DUE TO AN EXTREME LEVEL OF CONTAMINATION, YOU ARE ONLY ALLOWED
TO STAY IN THE CITYFOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME, LIMITED BY YOUR GAS MASK CANISTER LIFETIME.
THIS VALUE IS REPRESENTED ON YOUR VISOR DISPLAY AS \"CANISTER LIFETIME\". WHEN IT REACHES
ZERO, YOU ARE DEAD,BOY! YOU MUST KILL EM ALL BEFORE YOU CAN THINK ABOUT LEAVING THE ZONE.
THEREFORE, I STRONGLY ADVISE YOU NOT TO WASTE TIME ON SIGHTSEEING, AND FOCUS ON KILLING
THESE FILTHY BEASTS! BEWARE THEIR CLAWS,THOUGH. THEY CAN EASILY PUNCTURE YOUR ARMOUR
IF YOU RIN LOW ON AMMO, SEARCH FOR CANISTERS LEFT OVER BY PREVIOUS SQUADS. YOU MAY
ALSO FIND SOME WEAPONS. WHEN YOU GET HIT, SEARCH FOR A FIRST AID KIT. TRY TO KILL THE
ZOMBIES AS FAST AS YOU CAN. WE WILL RECORD YOUR TIME. CAN YOU BEAT IT IN THE NEXT RUN?
NOW, GET OUT OF HERE AND KILL SOME ZOMBIES GOOD LUCK!!!
